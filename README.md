# Personal projects:

## [Project 1: ECG signal analysis: detection of severe neurally mediated reflex syncope (ongoing)](https://github.com/Viottihugo/Detection-of-severe-neurally-mediated-reflex-syncope)

This is a collaborative project that tries to determine the position of severe neurally mediated reflex using data of ECG studies from patients that are known to have it.
We are aiming to find a characterization of the signals and then search for an appropriate model and apply it on similar datasets to see if those locations can be predicted.

Here's some visualization of the signals we are using for this!

# Internship projects:

## [Tutorial of supervised learning using decision trees](https://github.com/Viottihugo/Decision-Tree-Classifier)

Internship task for "The Sparks Foundation" in which it's shown how to apply the decision-tree prediction model to a given dataset. The code is explained in the jupyter notebook and I've made a tutorial video for it that you can check here [by clicking here.](https://youtu.be/D6SowLo6lTY)


# Practice projects:

## [Project 0.1: Data Cleaning and munging](https://github.com/Viottihugo/Practice-Project--Preparing-data)

Hands on data cleaning and manipulation using 3 datasets with information on the field of global economy. Some of the techniques included in this project are data parsing, cleaning and mapping, merging datasets and a bit of exploratory data analysis.

## [Project 0.2: EDA of the relationship between trips and new COVID-19 by day on the state of Michigan (ongoing)](https://github.com/Viottihugo/Covid-cases-and-transportantion-in-Michigan)

The idea of the project was to find if there's a possitive correlation between the registred trips on the state of Michigan, and the new confirmed COVID-19 cases for each day. We were trying to probe the hypothesis that "the more you travel, the easier it is to spread the virus", but the results turned out to be different (more on that later). Here is a peek of the results:
