# Personal projects:

## [Project 1: ECG signal analisis detection of severe neurally mediated reflex (neurocardiogenic or vasovagal) syncope](https://github.com/Viottihugo/Detection-of-severe-neurally-mediated-reflex-syncope)

This is a collaborative project that tries to determine the position of severe neurally mediated reflex using the ECG data of patients that are known to have it and then search for an appropriate model and apply it on similar datasets to see if those locations can be predicted.

Here's some visualization of the signals we are using for this!

# Practice projects:

## [Project 0.1: Practice on data manipulation](https://github.com/Viottihugo/Practice-Project--Preparing-data)

Hands on data cleaning and manipulation using 3 datasets with information. First time trying to merge different datasets into a new one.
